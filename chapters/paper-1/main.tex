    \textbf{Key findings/developments:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The decorrelation time of snow cover on top of the “Dummyfirn” area at X‐band was characterized.
      \item The inter‐seasonal and intra‐day behavior of monostatic and bistatic polarimetric parameters of the snow cover (entropy, mean alpha angle, polarization phase differences) were analyzed.
      \item Non‐reciprocal scattering was confirmed in the bistatic regime through measurement of the cross‐polarized phase difference.
    \end{itemize}
